## Before you start <a name="before_start"></a>

I'm using my Raspberry Pi with `Ubuntu Server 20.04` headlessly, so just plain in the cmdline, without any Desktop like `Gnome` installed.
In my experience, `Ubuntu` feels a bit heavy, but `Ubuntu Server 20.04` feels very light and is really nice to use.


## Handy commands <a name="handy_commands"></a>

Some handy commands, e.g. from [linuxhandbook][linuxhandbook/list_users_in_group] or [linuxhandbook][linuxhandbook/has_user_sudo-rights].

```zsh
# view all users
less /etc/passwd

# view all groups of the current user (or the user dominic)
groups
groups dominic

# view all existing groups
less /etc/group

# check if user dominic has sudo-rights
sudo -l -U dominic

# find all users in group sudo
grep '^sudo:.*$' /etc/group | cut -d: -f4
```


## Install Ubuntu Server 20.04 <a name="install-ubuntu-server-20.04"></a>

Installing `Ubuntu Server 20.04` is very simple using the `Raspberry Pi Imager`.
It's just writing the `OS` to the `SD`-card.
After starting the `OS`, login with the default login (probably `ubuntu` as both user and password).

Change the default keyboard-layout system-wide with (from [this forum][superuser/input-keyboard-layout])

```zsh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```


## Setup Internet and update the system <a name="setup_internet_and_update_system"></a>

Check if `nmcli` (`nm` for network-manager, `cli` for commandline-interface) is installed (for handling Internet via wifi).

```zsh
nmcli --version
```

If it is not installed, connect your Raspberry Pi via LAN with your router (but don't install `nmcli` yet).
In both cases, start your Pi and execute following commands.

```zsh
# first of all, update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# install nmcli now, if not installed
sudo apt install network-manager

# reboot after upgrading the system
sudo reboot

# now, you can unplug your LAN-connection

# show all wifi-networks
nmcli device wifi list
# and connect to one (--ask is for password)
nmcli --ask device wifi connect 'wifi-name'
# if not all wifi-connections are present, try it with sudo
```


## Setup user-management <a name="setup_user_management"></a>

For more info, see [ubuntu.com][ubuntu/security-users] and [howtogeek - How to Use the chmod Command on Linux][howtogeek/chmod_explanations].

The initial user and password are predefined and probably `ubuntu` (both user and password).
Per default, this user `ubuntu` is in one of the groups `sudo`, `wheel` or `admin` (all three are kind of the same thing with different names for backwards-compatibility).

1. Change the initial password of the current user using the following command (`<username>` is probably `ubuntu`).

    ```zsh
    passwd <username>
    ```

    This is important, since the default-user `ubuntu` is allowed to execute sudo-rights (even without being asked for the password).
    Later, when using `ssh` to access the system through your wifi-network (or Internet), this would be a __high risk__!

1. Set a root-password (or change the existing one?)

    ```zsh
    sudo passwd root
    ```

1. Attention: Edit `/etc/sudoers`, but only using `sudo visudo`.
    If you mess this file up (while not using `sudo visudo`), you can't access sudo-commands anymore.
    You can fix this by reinstalling the whole system or by booting with another OS (e.g. via USB-stick) to edit the file from there.
    That's why `sudo visudo` ensures, that your changes are valid and have no errors.
    I would add and/or edit following lines:

    Note: The editor is using `vim`.
    Long story short, move the cursor up/down/left/right with `k`/`j`/`h`/`l`, press `i` for inserting text, press `escape` for moving the cursor again.
    Save and exit by typing `:wq`.
    For more info, see [vim.md][github/self/vim.md].

    My `/etc/sudoers` looks like this:

    ```zsh
    ## Optional and only recommended, if you are familiar with vim.
    ## Otherwise, don't add this line.
    ## It just ensures, that only vim is allowed to open sudoers with visudo,
    ## which helps when you have set ${VISUAL}=code
    Defaults editor=/usr/bin/vim:/usr/bin/vi

    ## User privilege specification
    ## user hostname=(runas-user:runas-group) command
    root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

    ## Members of the admin group may gain root privileges admin is legacy, sudo
    ## is preferred
    %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

    ## Allow members of group sudo to execute any command (but with password)
    %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

    ## I would delete this line, since this line allows sudo without being asked
    ## for root-password.
    #%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL NOPASSWD: ALL

    ##
    ## !!! ATTENTION !!!
    ##
    ## I would highly recommend to delete this line, since a file in
    ## /etc/sudoers.d permits the user ubuntu to execute sudo without any
    ## password. Besides that, any file in there might corrupt your sudoers.
    ## #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
    ```

1. Create a new user for yourself.

    ```zsh
    # create the user dominic (just my name, you might use your name instead)
    #
    # -m
    # Create home-directory for this user
    #
    # -G sudo
    # Add this user to your sudo-group
    #
    # -s /usr/bin/bash
    # Set bash as default shell for this user (otherwise, it might be dash, which is not fully compatible with bash)
    sudo useradd -m -G sudo -s /usr/bin/bash dominic
    sudo passwd dominic
    ```

1. Logout (just `logout`) and login with your new user.
    If everything seems to work fine, you can continue.
    It is important, that you can use `sudo` with this user.
    Otherwise, after removing `ubuntu` in the next step, you have to login as root and fix your `sudo`-permissions, which is not recommended.

    ```zsh
    sudo -l -U dominic
    # or just this, if logged in as dominic
    sudo -l
    ```

1. Remove `ubuntu` from all `sudo`-groups and delete the user.
    You can just execute the commands, even if the groups don't exist.

    ```zsh
    sudo deluser ubuntu admin
    sudo deluser ubuntu sudo
    # Probably not used in Ubuntu Server, but Arch Linux is using wheel
    # If this group doesn't exist, it just prints some text.
    sudo deluser ubuntu wheel

    # delete the user, if you can use sudo with your new, safe user
    sudo userdel ubuntu
    ```

## Setup ssh (secure shell) <a name="ssh"></a>

Background for ssh: [digitalocean][digitalocean/ssh-encryption]

If you don't know `ssh`, it is basically a small service (= program) running on your Raspberry Pi, that allows you to open a terminal through Internet.

> It is important to edit your sudoers-file as mentioned above.
> Otherwise, you might have a default-user with default-password (`ubuntu`), which is able to use `sudo` without root-password.
> Obviously, this is a high security-risk for your server.

Most of this info is from [this blog][devconnected/ssh-server].
It has a quite perfect explanation, although I'm not confirming every code-snippet.
I'm mentioning below, where I disagree with their explanation and choices.

By default, `ssh` should already be installed.
This is the client-version, so you might connect to somewhere else.
What you probably want is connecting to your Raspberry Pi, so `ssh` doesn't help.
You need to install `openssh-server`.

```zsh
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, you can configure your `sshd`, which stands for `ssh-daemon`.
A daemon is a service, that is running in the background and waiting for something, e.g. a request through Internet to connect via `ssh` to your Raspberry Pi.

> Per default, every user with a non-empty password is allowed to login (source: [stackexchange][stackexchange/which_users_are_allowed_to_log_in_via_ssh]).
> To change this behaviour, [this blog (ostechnix)][ostechnix/ssh_access_per_user] might help.

Good sources for security are:

- [howtogeek - The Best Ways to Secure Your SSH Server][howtogeek/best_ways_to_secure_ssh]
- [raspberrypi][raspberrypi/security]
- [6 ssh authentication methods to secure connection (sshd_config)][golinuxcloud/ssh-authentication-methods]
- [howtogeek - How to Create and Install SSH Keys From the Linux Shell][howtogeek/ssh-copy-id]

```zsh
# in shell
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```zsh
# in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Prohibit login as root
PermitRootLogin no

# allow login only by public/private keys, not by password
# (replace dominic by your username)
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
# and only for specific users
AllowUsers dominic

MaxAuthTries 6


# allow login only for users with non-empty password
# (if passwords are enabled)
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# nope
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# you don't need it, so turn it off
X11Forwarding no
# yes so you will be logged out when sudo reboot
UsePAM yes
```

```zsh
# back in shell: apply changes
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

On your computer, that wants to access via `ssh`, create a `ssh`-key-pair and copy the public(!) key to the server.
Please note, that you have to enable `PasswordAuthentication yes` to copy your public key.

```zsh
# create public/private key-pair
ssh-keygen
# enter info

# copy to server
ssh-copy-id dominic@parga.io
```

> In contrary to [SCHKN][devconnected/ssh-server], I would not change the default-port.
> It doesn't bring you much more security, except for you change it to something quite unusual, which is unhandy and thus might confuse or "break" other software.

To check your daemons on a system, you can use `systemctl`.

```zsh
# check status of your sshd (probably active and already running)
sudo systemctl status sshd

# start sshd at boot
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# start sshd right now
sudo systemctl start sshd

# restart sshd, e.g. after updating the sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# stop sshd right now
sudo systemctl stop sshd

# stop sshd to start at boot
sudo systemctl disable sshd
```


## Setup ufw (firewall) <a name="#ufw"></a>

Setup your firewall (ubuntu firewall, called `ufw`), which is basically just a door for incoming and leaving Internet-connections.
A great source of code-snippets is [this blog][digitalocean/ufw_on_ubuntu_20.04].
You define these connections by ports.
The default port for `ssh` is 22, so this port has to be enabled.

```zsh
# shows current firewall rules
sudo ufw status verbose

# default-policy is probably
# - allow all leaving traffic
# - deny all incoming traffic
# but to change it:
sudo ufw default deny incoming

# allow ssh (which stands for port 22 according to /etc/services)
sudo ufw allow ssh
# is equal to
sudo ufw allow 22
# better:
# (limits access when trying to login more than 6 times in 30 seconds)
sudo ufw limit ssh

# for seeing the ports with their respective names, execute
less /etc/services

# for deleting rules, just add 'delete' in between
sudo ufw delete allow ssh

# enable ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo systemctl restart ufw
```

We're almost ready to connect.
What's missing is the ip-address.
Get it via `nmcli` as follows.
[SCHKN][devconnected/ssh-server] suggests `sudo ifconfig`, which is now deprecated.

```zsh
# show all devices with info, including your ip-address in your wifi-network
nmcli --pretty device show
# in short
nmcli -p d show

# prints something like
# ...
# IP4.ADDRESS[1]       192.168.178.58/24
# ...

# connect from your computer to your Raspberry Pi
# on your computer
ssh dominic@192.168.178.58
```

Ignore the suffix `/24`, which is the number of bits, that refer to your inner network.
Here, 24 bits are 3 bytes, which means that each device in your home-network has the same prefix `192.168.178`.
This also means, that your wifi-settings are probably available at `192.168.178.1` (entering it in a browser-window).
This is just the ip-address inside your network, so this is not unique on global scale and not visible from outside of your wifi-network.
To get your global ip and enable port-forwarding (sometimes called port-permissions), you have to visit your wifi-router-settings.
This is explained below.


## Setup domain and connect it to your Raspberry Pi <a name="setup_domain_and_ddns"></a>

Assume we want to use `domain.com` as our server-domain.
To reach the Raspberry Pi through the Internet, the following chain has to be complete:

1. A user enters `domain.com` into the browser (or you want to use `ssh dominic@domain.com`).

1. A DNS-server finds your routers ip-address using `domain.com`.

1. Your router forwards the request to your Raspberry Pi

1. The Raspberry Pi accepts the request (through `ufw` as already setup above)

In the following, we configure this domain according to my setup on `namecheap.com`.
Your router is changing it's public ip-address on a regular basis (probably daily).
So, to get the DNS-server to find your ip-address without updating the ip-address of `domain.com` at `namecheap.com` everyday, you might use dynamic DNS.

### Setup the DNS-server (via namecheap.com) <a name="setup_dns-server"></a>

1. Buy or rent a domain, e.g. on `namecheap.com`, which has pretty nice documentation and a nice UI.

1. Activate `DynDNS` via toggle-button.
    You will get your Dynamic DNS Password, let it be `asdfasdf`.

1. Add an A Record, which means that your domain is being mapped to an IP4-address.
    Make sure that this A Record has `DynDNS` included.
    On `namecheap.com`, this option is called `A + Dynamic DNS Record`
    - The host is just `@`, which is a special value here, representing your plain domain.
    - The value is your ip-address from your router.
      It doesn't matter, what you enter here, since this will change automatically after setting up your server.
      Just enter `127.0.0.1` (`localhost`).

1. You might want to add a CNAME Record, which maps a provided subdomain to the ip-address of an A Record.
    - e.g. `www.domain.com` or `nextcloud.domain.com` or `something.domain.com` should go directly to `domain.com`, which will be your router.
    - The host is just `www` (or `nextcloud` or `something` respectively).
    - The value is your domain, which should be the destination, so probably `domain.com`.
    - See [namecheap.com][namecheap/create_subdomain] for more info


### Setup your router <a name="setup_router"></a>

1. Visit your router's settings page in your browser (e.g. `fritz.box` or by the network-ip, in my case `192.168.178.1`, as mentioned above).

1. Depending on your router, this might differ.
    Enable port-forwarding (or port-permissions) for your ports.
    For now, this is just ssh, so port 22.

1. ATTENTION: Do not allow self-maintaining port-permissions.
    You don't need it and it's just a possible security-risk.

1. Enable `DynDNS` and your router will inform your domain-provider automatically in case of a ip-change.
    Enter your credentials for your domain-provider.
    In my case, this is `namecheap.com`.
    Since `namecheap.com` is not pre-configured, you have to use the update-URL, which is provided by `namecheap.com` on some [documentation-website][namecheap/dyndns-update-url].
    The URL will be something like `https://dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/update?host=@&domain=domain.com&password=asdfasdf` as explained in the following.

    ```text
    https://dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/update?host=[HOST]&domain=[DOMAIN]&password=[DDNS_PASSWORD]&ip=[IP]

    [HOST]:
    @

    [DOMAIN]:
    domain.com

    [DDNS_PASSWORD]:
    asdfasdf

    [IP]:
    If not provided, the caller of this URL uses its own ip-address.
    You want your router to call this URL, so the ip-address will be the new router's ip.
    ```

    The requested credentials are filled as following.
    Yes, it is your own domain and yes, it is the ddns-password.

    ```text
    Update-URL:
    see above

    Domainname:
    domain.com

    Username:
    domain.com

    Password:
    asdfasdf
    ```

You can (hopefully) connect via `ssh dominic@parga.io`.


## Setup an external drive for using mount-points (fstab) <a name="setup_external_drive"></a>

In case you want to use an external drive to store your data via mounting, this chapter is for you.
Note that I have added this functionality after setting up my nextcloud and I screwed my nextcloud up.
So be careful with this chapter and make backups.

Mounting (`mount --help`) is kind of making your harddrive accessable in your system.
You can mount drives and add extra access-points for directories.


### Difference between mount and symlink <a name="mount_vs_symlink"></a>

The difference between mounting and symlinking is noticable when changing your root-directory (`/`, e.g. `cd /`).
This happens using `chroot` or using containers like `Docker`.
Imagine a symlink going to `/new_root/asdf`, but your current root `/` is already at `/new_root`.
This symlink wouldn't work, since it would try to go to `/new_root/new_root/asdf`, which obviously doesn't exist.
Mounting would still work, because mounting is done relative to your root-directory `/`.


### Format device <a name="format_device"></a>

```zsh
# get disk's current name, e.g. /dev/sdb
# (might be different after reboot!)
sudo fdisk -l

# Create partitions with GPT partition table
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

```markdown
# in fdisk-tool
- delete partition
- create partition table
- create new partition
- change partition type to 'Linux filesystem'
- write
```

```zsh
# format partition /dev/sdb1
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

# get partition's UUID for mounting
sudo blkid 281d6519-1086-42d0-a2ab-0fbd797434fc
```


### Mount a device <a name="mount_device"></a>

In general, mounting-cmds are always `sudo mount <source> <destination>`.
A source might be a partition or a mountpoint, but nothing else!
So to mount only a certain directory of your external-storage-device, you have to mount the device first.

Great sources:

- General info about mounting and binding: [ubuntuusers][ubuntuusers/mount]
- Info about `fstab` (e.g. syntax and short explanations): [ubuntu-help][ubuntu/fstab]
- Info about `fstab` and automatically (un-)mounting devices: [archlinux][archlinux/fstab]

```zsh
# get (current!) disk-names (eg /dev/sda) or partition-names (eg /dev/sda1)
sudo fdisk -l
# shorter output and better overview, showing mountpoint
sudo lsblk

# get UUID (don't forget sudo or output might be empty)
sudo blkid

# mount device UUID=1234 to /mnt/1234
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/1234
sudo mount -U 1234 /mnt/1234

# mount subdir from device of UUID=1234 to /home/dominic
sudo mount /mnt/1234/subdir /home/dominic/subdir
```


### Mount a device at system-start <a name="fstab"></a>

You can edit `/etc/fstab` to mount at system-start.
__Attention!__
__If mounting with this file doesn't work (eg due to typo or missing directories), your system won't boot.__
You would have to edit the file from another running linux-system (eg via USB).

Keep in mind, that your `systemd`-services (database, eg postgres, and apache2) need to know, that your drives are mounted.
Otherwise, they might not start due to missing files, resulting in errors.
One example is mounting `/etc/postgresql`, which leads to `postgresql@12-main.service` being dead in `sudo systemctl status` (after reboot).
Hence consider mounting only data-directories, as described for postgresql in [digitalocean][digitalocean/move_postgres_data_dir].

To validate your file without reboot, you might use the command below (source: [serverfault][serverfault/forum/validate_fstab_without_rebooting]).

> Please note every slash (`/`) in the following commands, since they make a difference when using rsync.

```zsh
# in shell

# stop related services
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl stop postgresql

# copying current content to mount
sudo rsync -av /var/lib/postgresql /mnt/1234/var/lib
# make local backup
sudo rsync -av /var/lib/postgresql/ /var/lib/postgresql.backup
# check backup-content before removing
sudo ls -al /var/lib/postgresql.backup
# rm files and dotfiles to preserve directory with current access-permissions
sudo rm -r /var/lib/postgresql/*
sudo rm -r /var/lib/postgresql/.*

# update /etc/fstab
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

```zsh
# in /etc/fstab

# [Device] [Mount Point] [File System Type] [Options] [Dump] [Pass]
UUID=1234 /mnt/1234 ext4 defaults 0 0

# postgresql
# note the bind-option here
/mnt/1234/var/lib/postgresql /var/lib/postgresql ext4 defaults,bind 0 0
...
```

```zsh
# in shell

# Should be empty, but existent!
sudo ls -al /var/lib/postgresql

# To validate your /etc/fstab without rebooting
# -f stands for --fake, not for --force
sudo mount -fav
# still empty
sudo ls -al /var/lib/postgresql
# do mount (also checks, if directory exists)
sudo mount -av

# Should not be empty
sudo ls -al /var/lib/postgresql
```

I would mount:

- data-directories from `/var/www` (according to [nextcloud-backups][nextcloud/doc/backup])
  - `/var/www/your.nextcloud.com/config`
  - `/opt/nextcloud.parga.io/data`
    - before (changed, see above): `/var/www/your.nextcloud.com/data`
  - `/var/www/your.nextcloud.com/themes`

- The database

  Your files are probably at `/var/lib/postgresql/12/main`, printed by

  ```zsh
  sudo -u postgres psql -c "show data_directory;"
  ```

- Logging
  - `/var/log/postgresql`
  - `/var/log/apache2`
  - `/var/log/nextcloud`


## Setup Apache and TLS <a name="setup_tls"></a>

`TLS` is for accessing your domain via `https`.
Great sources:

- [How to Get Let's Encrypt SSL on Ubuntu 20.04][serverspace/letsencrypt]
  for creating a certificate and mentioning the `certbot.timer`

- Create the file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/domain.com.conf` and edit `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` according to

  - [digitalocean][digitalocean/apache2-setup] for apache-setup

  - [ubuntuusers][ubuntuusers/mod_ssl] for `TLS`

  - [upload.com][upload/enhance_encryption] for enhancing encryption (in `/etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf` and `/etc/apache2/sites-available/defaul-ssl.conf`)

  - Test your ssl-encryption via [this ssl-test][ssllabs/ssltest].

- [Apache-Docs: Directives in config-files][apache/docs/core]

- [Apache-Docs: SSL/TLS Strong Encryption: How-To][apache/docs/ssl-tsl_strong_encryption]

- FYI: Some best practices for web-server-config from [Nextcloud webroot and data directory - best practices on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS][nextcloud/help/nextcloud_data_dir_best_practices]

- Source: [serverfault-forum][serverfault/forum/which_apache-conf_is_used]

  ```zsh
  # NICE!
  # check, which config is loaded at runtime
  apache2ctl -V | grep SERVER_CONFIG_FILE
  ```

- Nice snippets:

  ```zsh
  # firewall
  sudo ufw allow http
  sudo ufw allow https
  sudo ufw reload

  # install apache2
  sudo apt install apache2
  # install letsencrypt to create a certificate
  sudo apt install letsencrypt

  # enable needed modules in apache2
  # ssl for encryption (https)
  sudo a2enmod ssl
  # for HSTS
  sudo a2enmod headers

  # this timer will renew your certificates automatically
  sudo systemctl status certbot.timer

  # deactivate apache2
  # such that certbot can use port 80 for creating the certificate
  sudo systemctl stop apache2

  # create your certificate
  sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d domain.com
  # or
  sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d domain.com

  # reactivate apache2
  sudo systemctl stop apache2
  ```


## Setup (or remove) postgresql <a name="setup_postgresql"></a>

In case you want to use `postgres`, look at the following commands to setup the database for nextcloud.
The source is [marksei - How to install NextCloud 20 on Ubuntu 18.04/19.04/19.10/20.04][marksei/install_nextcloud_on_ubuntu], but these commands are same as in the mariadb-related commands in the nextcloud-documentation.

```zsh
# in shell
sudo apt install postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql
```

To move your data-directory (not necessary due to mounts), follow the great guide from [digitalocean][digitalocean/move_postgres].

Setup nextcloud-database in `postgres`:

```sql
# in psql

CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;

CREATE USER nextcloud_user WITH PASSWORD 'YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE';
# TODO is the following working instead?
# maybe this command works (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nextcloud#PostgreSQL)
createuser -h localhost -P nextcloud

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nextcloud TO nextcloud_user;
```

Just in case you want to remove `postgres` completely (e.g. because you screwed up and want to reinstall it), use following commands from [ObjectRocket][objectrocket/remove_postgres]

```zsh
# uninstall postgresql
sudo apt --purge remove postgresql
sudo apt purge postgresql*

## Install nextcloud <a name="install_nextcloud"></a>

> Please note, that after installing `nextcloud` with following commands, your server, reachable under your domain, is waiting for setting up the nextcloud-admin.
> If you won't (kind of) immediately visit your domain and setup your nextcloud-admin, someone else might do this. 8-)

>__ATTENTION!__ It is highly recommended to change the default-location of nextcloud's data-directory (`/var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/data`) to [prevent issues from misconfiguration of the web-server][nextcloud/help/move_nextcloud_data_dir].
>This should be done when setting up the admin.
>Doing this after the installation needs to tinker around with the database.

After the postgres-setup, I used the official nextcloud's documentation [Example installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS][nextcloud/docs/example_ubuntu] to install all required packages and downloaded nextcloud.
Additional packages might be mentioned in the complete [nextcloud's documentation][nextcloud/docs].
The following is the combination of both, that I have installed.

```zsh
# install all required packages (excluding mariadb/mysql)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# required
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php7.4
sudo apt install php7.4-bcmath
sudo apt install php7.4-common
sudo apt install php7.4-curl
sudo apt install php7.4-gd
sudo apt install php7.4-gmp
sudo apt install php7.4-json
sudo apt install php7.4-mbstring
sudo apt install php7.4-xml
sudo apt install php7.4-zip
# database (pick yours)
sudo apt install php7.4-pgsql
# recommended
sudo apt install php7.4-imagick
sudo apt install php7.4-intl

# Module php-imagick in this instance has no SVG support. For better compatibility it is recommended to install it.
sudo apt install php libmagickcore-6.q16-6-extra
```

```zsh
# cd into Downloads
cd && mkdir -p 'Downloads/tmp' && cd 'Downloads/tmp'

# download nextcloud from https://nextcloud.com/install/
curl 'https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-20.0.4.zip' -o 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip'
curl 'https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.sha256' -o 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.sha256'

# Verify download
sha256sum -c 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.sha256' < 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip'

# Verify pgp-signature
wget 'https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.asc' -O 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.asc'
wget 'https://nextcloud.com/nextcloud.asc' -O 'nextcloud.asc'
gpg --import 'nextcloud.asc'
gpg --verify 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip.asc' 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip'
```

```zsh
# finalize
unzip 'nextcloud-20.0.4.zip'
sudo mv 'nextcloud' '/var/www/nextcloud.parga.io'

# cleanup
cd ..
rm -r 'tmp'
```

Now, you can follow the [Installation on Linux - Apache Web server configuration][nextcloud/docs/installation_on_linux/apache_configuration], but the important commands are mentioned below.

```zsh
# setup /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.parga.io

# needed for nextcloud
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod env
sudo a2enmod dir
sudo a2enmod mime

# finish installation
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/nextcloud.parga.io
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/nextcloud.parga.io/data

# restart
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Take a look at the settings and dig a little through [nextcloud's official documentation][nextcloud/docs].
To improve your server, play around a little in the settings.
You should have a look at [nextcloud - Hardening and security guidance][nextcloud/docs/hardening_and_security_guidance], e.g. for giving php read-access to `/dev/urandom` (as described in the [nextcloud's help-forum][nextcloud/help/php-access_to_/dev/urandom]).

You can find some settings for your `/etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini` in this file.

```php
memory_limit 512M
upload_max_filesize 2M
post_max_size 8M
```

I would set them in your `/etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.parga.io.conf`.

```zsh
## in nextcloud.parga.io.conf
<Directory /var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/>
  php_admin_value memory_limit 1024M
  php_admin_value upload_max_filesize 10G
  php_admin_value post_max_size 8M
</Directory>
```

You can see whether your nextcloud has these settings accepted in the admin's settings (probably under `System`).
Please note, that you can not upload large files in case you have too low numbers here.
But too large numbers make your server vulnerable for attacks (by your users, who should be trustworthy anyways because it's your server).


## Maintenance <a name="maintenance"></a>

Now, login as `admin` and click through your settings.
Most important is probably the section `Overview` and `Basic settings` for setting up the admin-mail-account (for notifications).
See [nextcloud-docs][nextcloud/docs/cron-jobs] for setting basic cron-jobs for your server.


### Logging and troubleshooting <a name="logging_and_troubleshooting"></a>

Nice tool from [nextcloud-help-forum][nextcloud/log-file-readability] for fabulizing json-output in cmdline:

```zsh
# install
sudo apt install jq
# get pretty json printed
tail -f /var/www/html/data/nextcloud.log | jq
```

General logging-locations:

- `sudo tail -f /var/log/nextcloud/nextcloud.log | jq`
  - before: `sudo tail -f /var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/data/nextcloud.log | jq`
- `sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log`
- `sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log`
- `sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log`
- In your nextcloud, logged in as `admin`, under `Settings -> Logging`

General troubleshooting:

- `pg_clusters`
- `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
- `sudo systemctl is-enabled postgresql`
- `sudo systemctl list-dependencies postgresql`
- `sudo systemctl status postgresql@12-main`
- `sudo systemctl is-enabled postgresql@12-main`


TODO

- List of supported directives in Apache-logging: `https://www.apacheviewer.com/log-format/`
- Infos about Apache-logging: `https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html`
- Example-mail-server with everything (including some logging-commands): `https://123qwe.com/tutorial-debian-10/`


### Backups and compressing data (using tar) <a name="backups_and_tar"></a>

Great sources

- [nextcloud - Backup][nextcloud/doc/backup]
- [ceos3c - How to Backup NextCloud and move them to another server][ceos3c/backup_nextcloud] (including nextcloud's maintenance-mode)

List of backupped files:

- Some configs
  - `/etc/postgresql`
  - `/etc/apache2`
- Nextcloud
  - `/var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/config`
  - `/var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/themes`
  - `/opt/nextcloud.parga.io/data`
- logging
  - `/var/log/postgresql`
  - `/var/log/apache2`
  - `/var/log/nextcloud`
- Database
  - do not copy files according to [Reddit][reddit/why_pg_dump_instead_of_copying], but use this command (see [nextcloud's docs][nextcloud/docs/backup_postgres] and [this blog of tecmint][tecmint/backup_and_restore_postgres] for details) to work with sql-files:

    ```zsh
    # NOTE: let this be stored in bash-history
    # -> create file and execute it
    sudo PGPASSWORD='1234' pg_dump 'nextcloud' -h '127.0.0.1' -U 'nextcloud_user' -F p -f '/mnt/backup/yyyy-mm-dd/database.psql.dump'
    ```

Cool snippets for checking directory-size

- `ls -alh`
- TODO Checking size of tar-commands: https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/124052


### Cronjobs <a name="cronjobs"></a>

TODO

- Renew LetsEncrypt certificate: `https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/renew-letsencrypt-certificate/34677`
- `https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/20/admin_manual/configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration.html#cron-jobs`
- `https://linuxhandbook.com/crontab/`
- `https://www.howtogeek.com/248780/how-to-compress-and-extract-files-using-the-tar-command-on-linux/`
- Cleanup or something?

  ```zsh
  sudo crontab -u www-date -e
  */5 * * * * php -f /var/www/nextcloud.parga.io/cron.php
  ```


### Optimizing disk-usage <a name="optimizing_disk_usage"></a>

Playing around with disk-tools might destroy your disk, so be careful and only execute commands, that you can understand!
I suggest taking a look at the manuals.

With `hdparm`, you can send some drives into standby-mode.
> Please note, that this means, that the writing-/reading-stick is being parked, causing wear at your disk.
> I can't find the source, but there
> It's the trade-off between power-consumption (and noice) and wearing out your disk.
> I assume, in almost every case, you don't have to mess around with `hdparm`.
> It's just for saving power (hence money) or reducing noice.

Good sources:

- [Very nice discussion about disks][debian/forum/aggressive_power-management]

  Also mentioning the tool `smartmontools` with its binary `smartctl`.

  ```zsh
  # note: no partition is provided, but the disk
  date && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda

  # show cycle-count of your disk
  date && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Load_Cycle_Count
  ```

- [How to play around with basic `hdparm`-commands][linuxundich/hdparm/drives_automatic_standby] and [Info about APM-values][ubuntuusers/Notebook-Festplatten-Bug]

  > Note: `apm` stands for `advanced power management`.

  Harmless snippets for `hdparm`:

  ```zsh
  # IMPORTANT: use the manual
  man hdparm

  # show info about your disk
  # (or show unknown in case your disk doesn't support hdparm)
  sudo hdparm -C /dev/disk/by-uuid/1234

  # check your apm-setting
  sudo hdparm -B /dev/disk/by-uuid/1234

  # ATTENTION
  # - set apm-value to very low power-consumption hence much wear (if keeping this value for days/months)
  # - values are nice explained in the manual
  # - holds until reboot
  sudo hdparm -B 1 /dev/disk/by-uuid/1234
  ```

- [How to configure `/etc/hdparm.conf`][armbian/forum/config_hdparmconfig]

  Please note, that you don't have a `systemctl`-service running for hdparm, because it is nothing, that has to be executed very often.
  Hence, your `/etc/hdparm.conf` is called in `/lib/hdparm/hdparm-functions`.
  You don't have to change anything in `/lib/hdparm/hdparm-functions` (and shouldn't), but it might help when configuring `hdparm`.

- In the first year, around 5% of the tested disks fail.
